      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        Hi, I’m Kennedy, the designer behind <strong>Williams & Co.</strong>. 
        I’m based in downtown Toronto and I love creating soft, thoughtful visuals with clean layouts and modern type. 
        My work is all about clarity, warmth, and making design feel beautiful without being overwhelming.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a certificate in marketing, which influences how I approach every project. 
        I always think about who the design is for, what it needs to communicate, and the feeling it leaves behind. 
        I love work that is visually calm, easy to understand, and intentional in every detail.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I’m not designing, I’m usually with Nugget, my rescue dog. 
        He has a huge personality for such a small guy and he often gets the zoomies right when I’m trying to focus. 
        He fully believes he is part of the creative team and I let him, because honestly, he makes everything more fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        I currently live in downtown Toronto and I’m able to commute anywhere in the GTA for meetings or collaborations. 
        I’m comfortable working in person, hybrid, or fully remote depending on what the project needs.
      </p>
