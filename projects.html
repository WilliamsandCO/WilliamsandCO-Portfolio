        <h3>Academic Design Studies</h3>
        <p>
          Projects completed through my studies at George Brown College. These pieces
          focus on building a strong foundation in typography, layout, and visual
          hierarchy while solving specific design briefs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> research, structured problem-solving, fundamentals.

        <h3>Identity & Logo Explorations</h3>
        <p>
          A collection of logo and brand concepts created for both real and imagined
          clients. Each exploration looks at how a simple mark, type choice, and
          colour palette can define a visual voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> logo marks, visual language, brand systems.

        <h3>Client Collaborations</h3>
        <p>
          Freelance work for small businesses and individuals. These projects are built
          around real needs, clear communication, and design that supports goals such
          as visibility, clarity, and cohesion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> communication, briefs, practical outcomes.

        <h3>Passion Projects & Experiments</h3>
        <p>
          Self-directed work where I test new ideas, aesthetics, and layouts without
          strict rules. These projects help me refine my style and explore directions
          I might bring into future client or school work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> experimentation, exploration, personal growth.

        <h3>Studio Assistant Approved</h3>
        <p>
          A playful set of pieces that have passed review from Nugget, my rescue dog
          and unofficial creative director. He usually gets the zoomies while I am
          working, but his energy definitely makes the process more fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> joy, personality, playful visual direction.
